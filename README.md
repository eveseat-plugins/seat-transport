## Installation
See the instruction over at the [seat documentation](https://eveseat.github.io/docs/community_packages/).

The package name is `recursivetree/seat-transport`.

Until [this](https://github.com/eveseat/eveapi/pull/337) PR gets merged, 
you need to run `php artisan eve:update:sde --force --no-interaction` after the plugin is installed and seat is back up running.

> please note that this plugin is still very early in development and might contain bugs and other problems.
